                <p>Everyone needs a laptop, especially when they have to go overseas for study.</p>
                <p>A laptop provides so many functionalities that can be vital to your social life as well as a facilitating your studies.</p>
                <p>Other than making web surfing everywhere possible, laptop can also provide utter convenience in other aspects.</p>

                                I was recommended by one of my online singaporean friend with this brand.
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                The website is very user-friendly, considering that there is an online enquiry system that replied to me in a split second.
                                <br/>
                                I was notified that the only Illegear Store is located at Oval Damansara, and it is not easy to reach there since I lived in Ampang.
                                <br/>
                                But, I still managed to convince my dad to bring me there.

                                <p>1) The laptop is made of plastic entirely, but it is really sturdy.</p>
                                <p>2) The abundance of ports made me worry less about buying additional adapters, and therefore a happy customer.</p>
                                <p>3) The keyboard is comfortable to type on, and the lighting effects are superior, making the aesthetics even more complimentable.</p>
                                <p>4) I really liked some of the preinstalled software inside, they really gave me an enjoyable experience to modify some settings such as contrast and fan speed.</p>
                                <p>5) The manual fan turbo button makes the customizability of the laptop went up another level.</p>

                                The touchpad has a small light at the top left corner, and touching it can toggle the touchpad to be disabled or enabled.<br/>
                                The fan and vent works together pretty well, and when I use turbo cooling, my machine cools down fairly quick.<br/>
                                The lid can be opened with one hand due to its massive base.

                                The keyboard layout is quite compact, but it does not affect my typing speed after some time of getting used to.<br/>
                                The lighting effects are superb. It is not some gimmick that can bore you overtime, it truly assists you to focus on your typing under dim enviroment.<br/>

                                Update(Aug 8th 2018): The spacebar of the laptop seems fragile, partly because of the supporting structure, a little bit of key movement flex is observed.<br/>

                                Not only that it allows you to manually modify the color and effects of your keyboard, but it also allows you to manually adjust the fan, screen color temperature, and turn off power source for display.</br>
                                It monitors your cpu and gpu's temperature and changes the speed of the fan AUTOMATICALLY.</br> 
                                Another software worth mentioning should be the Fang Command Center</br>
                                It allows you to modify some internal details of your mouse, including DPI and key bindings.

                                    The Fang Gaming mouse is one of the free accessories that deserves my compliment. Not only that there are a bunch of bindable keys (7 programmable keys)(Like a usual gaming mouse)<br/>
                                    BUT, It is all about the lighting effects!<br/>
                                    The LED at the side of the buttons and the base animatable LED lights.</br>
                                    The scroll is smooth and functional, and everything else is right on the point.<br/>
                                    <hr>
                                    Update(4th August 2018): The mouse's surface become smudgy easily if your hand tends to sweat profoundly, I think this is expected from a smooth surface.
                                    <br/>

                                    Another free accessory. The MatMaster is pretty huge(about 30cm*28cm) and it comes with two textures: <i>Smooth</i> and <i>Coarse</i><br/>
                                    The mat is too thick to be put between the lid and the keyboard, which means carrying it will require additional space.<br/>
                                    <br/>

                                    Free accessory too. The bag has an elegant appearance and the laptop fits inside the bag perfectly.(Guess this is pretty common huh)<br/>

                                Other than being informative while I am making the decision whether or not to buy the laptop, they also did a good job after selling their laptop.<br/>
                                I received my laptop after two weeks of placing an order, which feels like the only experience that dissatisfies me.
                                When I found that one of the softwares that is supposed to be installed on my machine went missing, I immediately contacted them via whatsapp. I carried my laptop into the store, and they fixed that for me in 10~15 mins.</br>

                                Update(4th August 2018): I did not know that fn+f4 disables wi-fi, luckily I received aid from illegear, glad that I now know more about my laptop. :)<br/>
                                Conclusion (Updated on 4th August 2018): <u>So far so good</u>.
